# SSSWatermarking


This is the implementation of secure spread spectrum watermarking from the article: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/ea0f/8aae9a72ca6bb07c14ba9a34fe252bf42672.pdf.
The project also includes a decoding script to extract the watermark and check the robustness of the watermarking based on the similarity function from the article.
